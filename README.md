# TESTUBE.ai
TESTUBE.ai is a domain created by a group of engineers who are working towards mitigating Tuberculosis in India which is considered to be the TB capital of the world using Artificial Intelligence. Our primary goal is to facilitate an optimzed treatment cycle for patients, specifically individuals residing in the rural sectors of India.
There are three different components that make up this project:
1) Web Application: This is the front end that is visible to doctors and chemists who utilise this website. The code and the different elements that make up the website can be found here.
2) AI Nurse: This folder consists of code that makes up the chatbot component of the project.
3) dCNN: The most vital component without which this project would not be functioning. This is a Convolutional Neural Network, running in the backened that helps doctors predict Tuberculosis from Chest X-Ray images.
